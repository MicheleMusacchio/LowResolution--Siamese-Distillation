# LowResolution Siamese-Distillation
This repository aims to provide an implementation of a novel architecture used for face recognition with low resolution images.
It consists of a vanilla knowledge distillation where teacher and student are both siamese networks.
In order to run the code you'll need to:
1) Downlaod the dataset from: https://vis-www.cs.umass.edu/lfw/
2) Run the dataset_creation.py to create the high and low resolution folders
3) Changing the paths in STUDENT.py, TEACHER.py, DK.py, Test.py and DK_Test.py.
4) Run the notebook Main.ipynb
